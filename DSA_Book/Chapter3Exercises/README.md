## Exercise 3.1

You are given a list, L, and another list, P, containing integers sorted in ascending order. The operation printLots(L,P) will print the elements in L that are in positions specified by P. For instance, if P = 1, 3, 4, 6, the elements in positions 1, 3, 4, and 6 in L are printed. Write the procedure printLots(L,P). You may use only the public Collections API container operations. What is the running time of your procedure?

## Exercise 3.2 Swap two given nodes of a linked list

1. if x and y are the same -> no change
2. Search for X, keep track of prevX and currX
3. Search for X, keep track of prevX and currX
4. Check if either x or y don't exist
5. If x not head -> prevX.next = currY. If head -> Y
6. Same for y
7. Swap next pointers

## Exercise 3.3 Find Intersection

Given two sorted lists, L1 and L2, write a procedure to compute L1 âˆ© L2 using only the basic list operations.
