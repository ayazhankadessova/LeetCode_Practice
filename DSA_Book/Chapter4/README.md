| 4.10  | Write a program that lists all files in a directory and their sizes.<br/>Mimic the routine in the online code. | Approach: <br/>1. Start listing with depth 0 <br/>2. Add spaces for depth;<br/>Print name of current file-><br/>if dir:dir+name;<br/>if file:fileName+length <br/>3. check current file is directory itself:<br/>if dir->repeat same for every file in dir. | [Solution](https://github.com/ayazhankadessova/LeetCode_Practice/blob/main/DSA_Book/Chapter4/FileSystem.java) | Feb, 24 |
| x. All file names  | Get all file names in a directory & subdirectory | Approach:<br/>1. push directory to stack<br/>2. While not empty -> pop<br/> if what we pop is file -> print; <br/>if what we pop is directory -> push all files in dir in stack;<br/>3.continue doing same w them | [Solution](https://github.com/ayazhankadessova/LeetCode_Practice/blob/main/DSA_Book/Chapter4/Allfiles.java) | Feb, 24 |
| 4.11  | BST with Insert, Delete, Find min | Approach:<br/>1. Insert BST checking for right/left.<br/>2. Delete based on cases: <br/>1) no children -> null; <br/>2) right/left child -> assign either. 3) 2 children -> get smallest from right subtree| [Solution](https://github.com/ayazhankadessova/LeetCode_Practice/blob/main/DSA_Book/Chapter4/BinarySearchTree.java) | Feb, 25 |
| 4.20-25  | AVL Tree Generic Implementation | AVLTree class is a self-balancing binary search tree that extends the Tree interface.<br/>1. Node class has two children (left and right) and stores data of a generic type T, a height attribute that is used to balance the AVLTree.<br/>2. AVLTree class includes methods to insert, delete, and search for nodes in the tree. <br/>3. Insert & Delete are same as in BST + updatHeigh and applyrotation to keep balance every operation.<br/>4. balance determines which rotation to apply: L, R, RL, LR.<br/>5. height of a node in the AVLTree is defined as the maximum height of its children plus one.| [Solution](https://github.com/ayazhankadessova/LeetCode_Practice/blob/main/DSA_Book/Chapter4/AVLTree.java) | Feb, 26 |
| L103  | Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).| Aproach: <br/>1. Add root to the queue. <br/>2. While queue is not empty, poll and add right and left children to the queue -> now the queue has right and left of the previous node. <br/>3. Repeat the process while queue is not empty. <br/>4. For every level, reverse/dont reverse alternatively. 4. Add every level to result list.| [Solution](https://github.com/ayazhankadessova/LeetCode_Practice/blob/main/DSA_Book/Chapter4/BinaryTree/BinaryTreeZigzag.java) | Feb, 27 |
