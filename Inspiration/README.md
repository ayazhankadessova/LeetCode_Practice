| [224. Basic Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/description/) | Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator <br/> to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation. | Approach -> DFS: <br/>Basic Setup: <br/>1. Create a char array to store operands and operators, everything from string value. <br/>2. Create an index field to keep track of the current index in the array. <br/>3. Call dfs(); <br/>DFS: <br/>1. Iterate through the character array <br/>2. Start with 0 sum and positive operator (no influence) <br/>3. Consider these cases:<br/>Case '(' -> need to find res inside the brackets & add it to res w the operator-> call dfs inside the bracket: index++; sum += oper * dfs res<br/>Case ')' -> brackets res ended:break; <br/>Case '+' / '-' -> set operator to +1/-1;<br/>Case digit -> can have multiple digit numbers, so iterate while char is not digit & add to StringBuilder* don't forget index-- here bc we stop on smth which isn't a digit, we need to consider it later <br/>all cases considered:<br/>Add to sum the number we found from StringBuilder * operator <br/>done -> iterate | [Solution](https://github.com/ayazhankadessova/LeetCode_Practice/blob/main/Inspiration/BasicCalculator/BasicCalculator.java) | Feb, 23 |
