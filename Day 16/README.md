## Daily(Rotate Image)

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

* Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

## Task 1(Pascal's Triangle)


Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

* Example 1:

Input: rowIndex = 3

Output: [1,3,3,1]
