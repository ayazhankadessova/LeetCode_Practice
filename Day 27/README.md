## Task 1(First Unique Character in a String)

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

- Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: 0

- Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"

Output: 2

- Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"

Output: -1

- Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105

s consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Task 2 (Pow(x, n))

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

- Examples:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10

Output: 1024.00000

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3

Output: 9.26100

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2

Output: 0.25000

Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25

## Task 3 (Permutations)

Bonus Problem: Valid Palindrome II

Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

- Examples:

Input: s = "aba"

Output: true

Input: s = "abca"

Output: true

Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.

Input: s = "abc"

Output: false
