## Daily (Binary Tree Pruning)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

A subtree of a node node is node plus every node that is a descendant of node.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,0,0,1]

Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
Explanation: 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.
