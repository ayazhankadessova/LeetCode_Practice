    # Queues are different from arrays and lists in that queues are not random accessâ€”the data stored in a queue has a particular order. So if you want to add an item to a queue, it will be added to the end. This is called first-in, first-out, or a FIFO queue for short.
    # Dequeues - But what if we want to add and remove a number of items from either end of our queue? This is where the deque function comes in. By using deque, we can create a double-ended queue where we can add and remove elements from the start or end of the queue. Deques are last-in, first-out, or LIFO for short.
