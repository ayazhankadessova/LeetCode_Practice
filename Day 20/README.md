## Task 1(Intersection of Two Arrays)

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]

Output: [2]

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]

Output: [9,4]

Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.

## Task 2(Happy Number)

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.


* Example 1:

Input: n = 19

Output: true

Explanation:

12 + 92 = 82

82 + 22 = 68

62 + 82 = 100

12 + 02 + 02 = 1

* Example 2:

Input: n = 2

Output: false
