## Task 1 (Rotate Array)

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3

Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Explanation:

rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]

rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]

rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

## Task 2 (Sort the matrix diagonally)


A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end. For example, the matrix diagonal starting from mat[2][0], where mat is a 6 x 3 matrix, includes cells mat[2][0], mat[3][1], and mat[4][2].

Given an m x n matrix mat of integers, sort each matrix diagonal in ascending order and return the resulting matrix.

 

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[3,3,1,1],[2,2,1,2],[1,1,1,2]]

Output: [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,2],[1,2,3,3]]
