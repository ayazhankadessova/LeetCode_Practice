## Chapter 3.1

You are given a list, L, and another list, P, containing integers sorted in ascending order. The operation printLots(L,P) will print the elements in L that are in positions specified by P. For instance, if P = 1, 3, 4, 6, the elements in positions 1, 3, 4, and 6 in L are printed. Write the procedure printLots(L,P). You may use only the public Collections API container operations. What is the running time of your procedure?
