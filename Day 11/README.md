## Daily Challenge (Power of four)

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x such that n == 4x.

* Example 1:

Input: n = 16

Output: true

# Task 1 (Add Binary)

Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

* Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"

Output: "100"

## Task 2 (implement strstr)

Implement strStr().

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
